Welcome to the Gramps Web User Guide.  This User Guide contains all the information you need to work with Gramps Web and start contributing to your Family Tree Database.  Gramps Web was designed to leverage the power of the internet and help families work on their Family Tree together.

This User Guide may be navigated via the Page links at left.  On most pages (but not all), there is a Table of Contents (TOC) for that page on the right side. (*see image at right*)

Gramps Web is intended for private use and is not a public website such as *ancestry.com*. We assume that your Gramps Web site is administered by someone you know (***the administrator***), for your family project(s) alone, and subsequently invited you to register and join.

The topics at left are ordered in the most logical order for someone new to Gramps Web and we recommend you read over them in order. The final section,  ***How Tos*** contain numerous step by step examples of the most common activities performed in Gramps Web and is a great resource if you do not use Gramps Web frequently and need some directions.

Thank you for your interest in Gramps Web, we hope you enjoy using it!
