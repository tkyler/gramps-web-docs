When most people think of a Family Tree, they generally envision something that looks like so:

*	TODO: family tree image

Gramps Web have the ability to display Family Trees in Multiple Ways: 

	*	Ancestor Tree
	*	Descendant Tree 
	*	Hourglass Graph
	*	Relationship Graph
	*	Fan Chart  

In order to display a Family Tree, Gramps Web must know two things.

*	Who is the ***Home Person?*** 
*   How many Levels of your Family Tree to Draw.

##	Home Person

If Gramps Web is to draw a Family Tree, it needs to know with whom to begin.  This is the ***Home Person***.  Home Persons can be selected from your ***Home Page*** and can be set to be any Person in your database.  Its very common to change the Home Person while your work on your Database.

##	Levels to Draw

When we say ***Levels***, then we mean either ***Generations*** or ***Degress of Separation***.  Generations refers to ancestors or descendants above and below the Home Person. Degrees of Separation mean relatives in ***All Directions***, both above below and to the side.  1 Degree of Separation would be your Spouse, Parents, Children and any Siblings.  2 Degrees of Separation would be all those connected to your 1st Degree of Separation Persons, so your Children's spouses, the children of your children (grandchildren), your "sibling-in-laws", and parents of your parents (grandparents), etc.
