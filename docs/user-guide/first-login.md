When logging in to Gramps Web for the first time, a form will be displayed requiring the user to select a language for the frontend and a home person.

This home person does not have to coincide with the home person in Gramps desktop &ndash; it is a personal setting for every user of Gramps Web. The home person is used e.g. for the initial view of the family tree. A typical choice would be for a user to select themselves as home person.

To select a person as home person, start typing in the text field and a drop-down list with matches will appear.

The language and home person settings are stored in the browser's local storage, so they will persist on a given device.
